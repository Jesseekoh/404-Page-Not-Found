## Overview

My [404-page-not-found](https://jesseekoh-404pagenotfound.netlify.app/) was a nice challenge for me to try bringing a figma design to fruition. I learnt how to host a site online using netlify. I learnt some css tricks like how to keep the copyright text always at the bottom of the page even if the content is not up to that.
